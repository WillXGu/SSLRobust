# SSLRobust
Multitask learning has been shown to strengthen adversarial robustness. When one output is attacked, others are affected as well because adversarial perturbations must also affect the shared encoder layers. Self-supervised labels are intrinsic: if the output is incorrect, we can create and apply a cleaning perturbation!
